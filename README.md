## Revisions

Need to do some cultural setup: what the Roman empire was, who the Gentiles are, etc.

Need to balance the textbook better. There is too much content for the first half of the book (1-10) and too little for the last half of the book (11-16).

0102 might be able to be removed completely or at least greatly shortened, since it is too topical and not following the Scripture itself (the topical ideas are covered more in detail later and it is best to cover it there to avoid repetition).

Chapter 3 is a good place to shorten. There are five files for this chapter.

Chapter 7 is a little long.

There are no real notes for chapter 11.

Chapter 16 has too much of just copied commentary.

Need to figure out how to make it easier for the students to follow. Going verse by verse is admirable and good for a commentary, but these are pastors and people who want to know "what this means for me?" We need to balance interpretation and application. We do not need to cover every verse.

## Questions

- Should "gentile" be capitalized?
- Should "law" be capitalized?
- When should the word "law" be used and when should "Torah" be used?
