## Revisions

Need to do some cultural setup: what the Roman empire was, who the Gentiles are, etc.

Need to balance the textbook better. There is too much content for the first half of the book (1-10) and too little for the last half of the book (11-16).

Chapter 1 does not cover v. 24-32

Chapter 7 is a little long.

There are no real notes for chapter 11.

Chapter 16 has too much of just copied commentary.

Need to figure out how to make it easier for the students to follow. Going verse by verse is admirable and good for a commentary, but these are pastors and people who want to know "what this means for me?" We need to balance interpretation and application. We do not need to cover every verse.

## Questions

- Should "gentile" be capitalized? Yes
- Should "law" be capitalized? No
