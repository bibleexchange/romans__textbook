# The true purpose of the law (v. 20—30)

## The law has never justified anyone (v. 20)

The law is accusatory by nature against all mankind. The true purpose of the law is not to justify, but is to bring the knowledge of sin. Alone, the Law cannot produce salvation or righteousness in the eyes of God. Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ Jesus.

## The righteousness of God is manifested to men (v. 21—23)

To manifest is to show forth or to declare.

### Declared Righteous

The meaning of "justify" is to declare righteous. To be justified is to be placed in a right relationship with God. Paul is telling men how they can be justified or declared righteous — through Jesus Christ.

> Most important, justification does not mean that God makes us righteous, but that He declares us righteous. Justification is a legal matter. God puts the righteousness of Christ on our record in the place of our own sinfulness.

Yet, salvation is not complete in this statement. For, In God's declaration of justification, He by giving us His righteousness has made us righteous (Romans 5:19).

### Righteousness refers to moral purity

It simply means to be right which is the opposite of being wrong. Sin is wrong and God is right. Applied to God it refers to the perfection or holiness of his nature; God is always right.

### This righteousness is from God

This is not earned righteousness or even righteous works. Justification is the righteousness of God put to the account of a man; that is God counting him righteous solely due to the righteousness of Christ. This passage is showing man the source of righteousness which only comes from God.

## God's method of justification (v. 24)

### Given by the Grace of God

Sinful man does not deserve to be justified. Man deserves to die because of sin. God freely justifies those who receive the provision of Christ by faith. Salvation is a gift of God to those who receive the provision of Christ by faith.

### Through the redemption in Christ Jesus

Redemption means to purchase, to set free by the payment of a ransom. Jesus paid the price for our Salvation in His blood. Man is declared righteous solely on the merit of Jesus Christ.

## The demands of the law have been satisfied (v. 25)

### God still requires justice

Justification is not merely God showing pity on the sinner and letting him go free without the penalty being paid. The word propitiation is used in reference to Christ satisfying the demands of the law. Propitiation is a reason for not executing judgment which is deserved. It corresponds to the Hebrew word rendered mercy seat which was the place the blood of atonement was sprinkled to satisfy the judgment of God. This sprinkled blood covered the Tables of the Law contained in the Ark. This is a figure of Him who was to come and shed Divine blood to satisfy the law. The blood of Jesus is the reason that judgment is not executed on the repentant sinner.

### Propitiation

Propitiation properly signifies the removal of wrath by the offering of a gift. In the Old Testament it is expressed by the verb kipper (atonement). The objection to propitiation arises largely from an objection to the whole idea of the wrath of God, which many exponents of this view relegate to the status of an archaism. They feel that modern men cannot hold such an idea. But the men of the Old Testament had no such inhibitions. For them 'God is angry with the wicked every day' (Ps. 7:11, AV). They had no doubt that sin inevitably arouses the strongest reaction from God. He is vigorously opposed to evil in every shape and form while he may be 'slow to anger'.

### Let us look at the phrase for the remission of sins that are past

In the Old Testament period, the blood of animals could never take away sin (Heb. 10:4). The blood of animals, a shadow of the blood of Christ, was only temporary until the time when Jesus would come and offer Himself as the supreme sacrifice for sin. The literal translation of this phrase is: "God had passed over the sins that were past." This He did knowing that Jesus would come and pay the price in full upon the cross. The blood of animals was like a credit until the price could be paid. No man was ever saved by the blood of an animal; all men have only been saved by the blood of Jesus both Old Testament and New Testament.

## A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law ( v. 28)

### Faith is the requirement to receive from God.

### Works of the law cannot secure justification.
