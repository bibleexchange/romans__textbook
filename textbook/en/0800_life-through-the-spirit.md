# Chapter 8: Life through the Spirit

## Those in Christ are no longer condemned (v. 1—9)

### They walk in liberty with no condemnation (v. 1)

The deliverance Paul cried for in 7:24 is announced in 8:1. Sin brought bondage, but the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has worked great liberty! **Our position in Christ** includes freedom from condemnation.

### They walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit

The righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us through following Christ by the leading of the Holy Ghost. There are two ways to walk the path of life:

1. following after the flesh
2. following after the Spirit of God

My will may not always be contrary to God's will, but to prioritize the flesh over the Spirit of God is the very recipe for failure. The carnal mind or the mind that is governed by that which is carnal is the very definition of rebellion against God (v. 7). To walk after the flesh is to not trust Christ as Savior and not follow him as Lord of all. Walking after the flesh is a lifestyle centered on myself. To walk after the Spirit, is to walk where He leads. This will require self-denial and involves a process of maturity. In Galatians 5:16—26, The "fruit of the Spirit" are contrasted with the "works of the flesh."

### They walk according to a new law (v. 2—3)

#### There are three laws mentioned here

1. **The law of sin and death**. It is like the law of gravity always pulling you down. It opposes that which is good and godly. It brings you into bondage and condemnation. Bondage to sin makes you a servant to Satan. Serving the law of sin brings death. (7:22—23)
2. **The law of God** (given through Moses). It is righteous, good, and holy. It opposes sin and the works of the flesh. It brings you to conviction and decision. The law being weak cannot save but does point to Christ.
3. **The law of the Spirit of life**. This law is greater than the law of sin and death. It is the life of Jesus imparted to the believer by faith. Liberty is man's born again state—free to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. Serving the Lord brings more abundant life. Every believer must manifest the life of Jesus more and more.

#### The fulfilling of the "law of the spirit of life" (v. 4)

It is fulfilled in the one that walks not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. If the Spirit of God dwell in you then His life is fulfilled in you. You no longer try to serve God in the flesh, but you have the Spirit of Christ to inspire and insure life. This life is not your own, but is Christ's life (Gal. 2:20). This life is not debtor to the flesh, but to God to serve Him and obey Him (v. 12). This life is fulfilled in mortifying carnal deeds of the flesh (v. 13).

### They walk with a new mind (v. 5—6)

Those in Christ do things differently—both actions and thoughts. They walk following after the Spirit of God. Walking after the Spirit also includes minding the things of the Spirit. The Spirit of God will lead us to life, but the flesh will lead to death and self-destruction.

### Ye are in the Spirit, if the Spirit is in You (v. 9)

## Those in Christ have received the spirit of adoption (v. 10–17)

### Having received the spirit of adoption, I have received a new work (v. 10–13)

We can see the importance works of righteousness in verses 10 through 13.

#### Because of Christ's work, I have life (v. 10)

Because of sin, your body is subject to death, but because of righteousness your spirit is subject to life!

#### Because of the work of the Holy Ghost, I am alive (v. 11)

The Holy Ghost raised Jesus from the dead. The mortal body that is subject to death is made alive by the Holy Ghost.

1. The Spirit gives life by freeing the believer from sin and death.
2. The Spirit gives life by doing what the law could not do.
3. The Spirit gives life by condemning sin in the flesh.
4. The Spirit gives life by Christ providing righteousness for us.

#### Because I am alive, I work (v. 12–13)

### Having received the spirit of adoption, I have been received into a new family (v. 14–17)

Are we all God's children? All people are God's creation, but only those born again are God's children (John 1:12–13; Gal. 3:26; Col. 1:16).

1. The Spirit gives guidance (v. 14)
2. The Spirit gives adoption (v. 15)
3. The Spirit gives witness (v. 16)

#### Heirs of God (v. 17)

The believer receives the privileges and inheritance of a son because he shares a relationship with the Father.

## Patiently wait for the adoption (v. 18—25)

Because of sin's presence in the world, we do not see the fulness of the glory of God. The believer has great things to look forward to in God. God has done great things in and for the believer and there is yet a redemption that we patiently wait for in hope or faith! What does the believer have to look forward to?

### Suffering unto glorification (v. 18)

Trials prove the true character of the Christian. Although the suffering is not glorious, Paul brings our attention to glory that will follow. The Christian has hope in suffering, for if we suffer, we shall also reign. Christ is our example of suffering (1 Pet. 2:21; Heb. 2:10; 5:8—9; 1 Pet. 4:1; James 5:10).

### The creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God (v. 19—22)

God has a vast plan and hope lies ahead for creation. In bondage because sin is in the world, but there will be a deliverance!

## Will be glorified through the ministry of the Holy Ghost (v. 26–30)

### The Holy Spirit helps our weaknesses (v. 26)

The Holy Spirit is our divine helper.

### Jesus is our intercessor (v. 27)

Hebrews 7:25; 1 John 2:1; 1 Timothy 2:5

### God's purpose wins (v. 28)

God providentially cares for his people (the called). These "called" are not just invited, but they are appointed. Here "the called" are marked by the electing grace of God. As God is sovereign, if God has a purpose, it will come to pass. God's major purpose in the life of the Christian is for him to be conformed to the image of His Son (v. 29).

## Have God as their advocate (v. 31–39)

The end of the chapter deals with the Christian's hope, which is "If God be for us who can be against us." It also deals with the idea that we are more than conquerors and that all things work together for good. The sufferings we go through are to teach us our motives.

### The power of God's love (v. 35–39)

- God's love is unaffected by the extreme conditions — "Neither death nor life" (Rom. 14:8; Phil. 1:20, 21)
- God's love is unaffected by spiritual powers — "Nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers"
- God's love is unaffected by time — "present or to come"
- God's love is unaffected by life's circumstances — "nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature"

## Conclusion

The two fold secret of Christian living is described by two phrases in verse 1 and verse 10: "in Christ Jesus" and "if Christ be in you." The Christian's will is to live in Christ an life pleasing to God. The Holy Spirit dwells in us, empowering us to live such a life.
