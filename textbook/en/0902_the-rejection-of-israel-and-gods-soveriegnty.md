# The inclusion of Gentiles in the promise (9:6—29)

## The True Israel is According to the Promise (v. 6—10)

The majority of Israel has missed the point. Christ is the fulfillment of the law, but Israel stumbles over him as if a stone and hold to their laws and religion. They think they are the children of God because they are the children of Abraham and Isaac and that they are the ones to whom the law was revealed.

The fact that the Gentiles were included in the promises raises the questions "Did the Word of God fail?" and "Did God fail to carry out His promises?"

The real Israel is the elect, not a natural seed. We see the plan of God as it unfolds. Not everyone that is born a part of the nationality of Israel are a part of Spiritual Israel. The children of the Israel are only children of the flesh, but the children of the promise are the children of God (John 3:6 "born of the Spirit"). The New Testament church is referred to as "the Israel of God" (Galatians 6:16) because of their faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ—not because of their family lineage (10:1—4).

## Election or predestination is not of works of Him that calleth (v. 11—13)

Election is mentioned in verse eleven. Election or predestination is not an unrighteous act for God may justify whom He may and condemn whom he desires. All the good works of men cannot make them children of the promise, but that condition is dependent upon God showing mercy.

It is important to understand from Scripture how predestination or election works. Predestination and election is based upon God's foreknowledge. He knows the end from the beginning He knows who will receive and who will reject before they are even born (8:29). Some are given 100 years and others only a few. It is man's responsibility to respond in the time of mercy for turning to God cannot happen just on a man's whim, but he must be drawn by the Father (John 6:44).

## God is righteous in mercy and hardening (v. 14—18)

How is God's sovereignty expressed? God is a sovereign God so therefore he is also a just God.

## Clay in the potter's hand (v. 19—24)

### God is Just (v. 19)

### God is sovereign (and man is responsible) (v. 20)

### God is purposeful (v. 21)

### God is right

- Hypothetical "A" (v. 22)
- Hypothetical "B" (v. 23—24)

## The calling of God's people (v. 25—29)

In verse 25 Paul, takes from the prophet Hosea (2:23) a passage that is specifically spoken to Israel, but has not found a fulfillment in Israel but rather is seen fulfilled in the Gentiles receiving the Gospel. The sentences in the latter part of this verse are very abrupt, but exceedingly expressive; leaving out those words supplied by the translators: I will say to Not my people, thou my people; and they shall say, my God (1 Pet. 2:9—10).

In verse 26, we see the Gentile people. God's infinite grace takes up those who were once called "dogs" (Matt. 15:26) and gives them a heavenly calling "Called to be children of the living God."

In verse 27 the apostle quotes another prophet, Isaiah, concerning a remnant (Isa. 10:22).

The ways of God are not our ways. He waits long - He forbears - He is silent: then suddenly puts into execution an eternally formed purpose.

Verse 29 is a quote from Isaiah 1:9 shows that if God had not intervened by his grace, they would have all become as Sodom and Gomorrah (2 Thessalonians 2:7).
