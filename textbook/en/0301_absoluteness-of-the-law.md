## The Absoluteness of the Law (Romans 3:3–8)

### The Standard is an Unchanging Christ

We have made a distinction between the specific prescriptions given through Moses and the much more encompassing Mind of God. It is a great error to make the Law of Moses as the entire prescription of God's will. The fullness of God's Will is much larger than the Law given through Moses.

It is in Jesus, we see the fullness of God's will. The Lord Jesus Christ is the standard of God's expectation (Eph. 4:11—16).

For the purposes of our study we have defined The Law of God as:

> God's standard of expectation for his creation.

God's Law is governed by the nature of God. What is in the Law of God is because of Who God is. God is absolute and therefore His Law is absolute--his expectations of the behavior of humanity are absolute. (The majority of the time, Human self-government is anything but absolute.)

> 2 Samuel 22:31—As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him. (Compare with Psalm 101)

### If some do not believe, will God break his promise? (v. 3—4)

Has God cancelled his covenant with Abraham because some Jews are bad? If some do not believe does it hinder God's plan? Will unbelief cancel God's faithfulness? See 2 Timothy 2:13.

#### The Jews Cling to their Heritage as Abraham's Children as their Warranty (v. 3)

Their objection was even though some did not believe; nothing can nullify our special promises we have been given by God through Abraham. They were in effect saying no matter what else we are, we are Abraham's seed and that will get us into heaven.

#### The answer: Absolutely Not! (v. 4a)

Will God be unfaithful because man is unfaithful? Absolutely Not!

> 2 Timothy 2:13 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he **cannot deny himself**.

It is not because, some Jews were unfaithful that requires faith in Jesus Christ. It is because the fullness of God's plan of redemption has always been in Christ.

#### Illustrated from David's Life (v. 4b)

The Psalm of David is quoted which showed God to be righteous even when David was condemned for his sin. According to Psalm 51:4, God is just when He speaks and clear when He judges. This is used here to show that God is right to condemn the Jews because they rejected the Messiah who came from the seed of Abraham according to the promises. These promises they claimed would justify them in fact brought condemnation to the Jew because of their rejection of Jesus Christ.

### If our sin commends God's righteousness, how can He judge us? (v. 5—7)

#### Let us first understand the meaning of the question.

We must rely on the context to help us understand the meaning of this question. This is posed as two questions in the text and has been simplified for the purpose of study. The question is literally asking: if our unrighteousness magnifies or brings attention to God's righteousness and mercy; is God unrighteous if He judges us?

This is still awkward for us to understand. Remember God is dealing with the actual objections of the Jews. The objection is the same as the objection of many today. We could ask it this way: If God is so righteous why would He judge me for my sin and send me to hell? (Especially, because we are Abraham's children.)

#### God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

The answer is: Certainly not. For if this principle is used then how could God pass judgment on the world? The world here is referring to the Gentiles. The Jews were still trying to excuse themselves from condemnation. It is proper for a righteous God to judge the unrighteous sinner—whether Jew or Gentile.

The truth is, God can judge the world because he is righteous.

### Let us do evil that good may come? (v. 8)

Some abuse the truth of God's mercy and boast that their sinful lives and God's unconditional acceptance, is illustrative of God's great Mercy. Paul was NOT preaching this false doctrine, but was being accused of doing so.

This was an attack on Paul's preaching of justification by faith. The Jews were saying: you tell us God justifies the wicked, so why not continue to be evil so good can come out of it?

Paul's description of those who did preach this was: whose damnation is just. Since the accusation was not true Paul did not go into a detailed answer; he only affirms that God's judgment on them is just.
