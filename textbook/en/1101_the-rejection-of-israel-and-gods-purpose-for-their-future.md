# Romans chapter 11

## The remnant of Israel (11:1—10)

The rejection is of the unbelieving Jew (Acts 14:2; Rev. 21:8).

<!--Many Jews did believe in Christ. All the disciples were Jews. The church on the day of Pentecost was made completely of Jews.-->

## The Gentiles are grafted in (11:11—24)

God's mercy (Ps. 13:5; 89:2; James 5:11).

<!--Gentiles are not replacing the Jews, but they have been invited to join into the covenant that God made with Abraham.-->

## All Israel will be saved (11:25—36)

<!--My initial thought is that v. 33-36 are not disconnected from the rest of Chap. 11,
but are a proclamation of trust in God that He knows what He is doing concerning the salvation of both the Jews and the gentiles.-->
