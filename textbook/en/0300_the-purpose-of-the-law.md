# Chapter 3: The purpose of the Law

## Introduction

In Chapter 3, we have five principles concerning the Law:

1. The true advantage of having the law (v. 1–2)
2. The absoluteness of the law (v. 3–8)
3. The unbending authority of the law (v. 9–19)
4. The true purpose of the law (v. 20–30)
5. The establishing of the law (v. 31)

Paul sets the law in its right perspective. Jesus did not and Paul does not eliminate the law as worthless, but does position it properly in the perspective provided by the revelation of the cross. In Judaism, the law is king, but according to the Gospel there is righteousness and justification without the deeds of the law.

### What Law?

The word "law" generically means "a principle; a prescription". Though it was to the Jew who was given the law of God through Moses, both Jews and Gentiles had the law of God in their conscience (whether or not they chose to receive it was their choice).

Throughout Romans, Paul illustrates the weakness of the law given to Moses and yet at the same time establishes its true value. The law given to Moses is indeed the will of God, but it is not the entirety of his instruction.

Though we can find the same word "law" used in 52 verses in Romans, Paul is not always discussing the same set of principles or prescriptions.

- Romans 2:12–13, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25, 26: The Jews had the law of Moses and the Gentiles did not. The Jews boasted and rested in the law given through Moses and because of the keeping of the deeds of this Law.
- Romans 2:14–15: The Gentiles did have a law in their heart or their conscience
- Romans 3:27: Law of faith.
- Romans 7:2: Law of her husband
- Romans 7:22: Law of God
- Romans 7:23: Law of Sin
- Romans 8:2: Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus
- Romans 9:31: Law of righteousness

Moses was used as an oracle of God, but he was not the only nor the last of God's messengers. Ultimately, he was only trailblazer for the Living Word! The law in our conscience or the law given through Moses are both abstractions of the law of God. God gave His eternal principles to Moses and God desires His will, His law, His prescriptions to be hidden in the heart of every person and realized in their life.

> Romans 3:28—Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.

A man can be justified in the eyes of God without the deeds of the law of Moses (thief on the cross). A man is never justified if he is contrary to the mind of God.

## The true advantage of having the law (v. 1–2)

### The advantage is not that they are inherently superior to the Gentiles

Many Jews continued to reject the Gospel and hold to their pre-eminence and exalted position in Jehovah simply because of their lineage to Abraham. Most Jews were appalled by the concept of the Gentiles being equal to them and having the same access to God as them through faith in Jesus.

### The advantage is they had first received the oracles of God

The Jews had received the prophecies of the Messiah and therefore had an advantage of increased revelation of Messiah that the Gentiles did not have. The advantage the Jew had was the very thing that condemns him as many still continue to reject Jesus as the Messiah (John 1:11).

The advantage of knowing the law is not that that knowledge justifies us, but is that by hearing of the Word of God to us is opened an opportunity to receive faith in God. We can know better and miss our opportunity to please God.

## The absoluteness of the law (Romans 3:3–8)

### If some do not believe, will God break his promise? (v. 3—4)

Has God cancelled his covenant with Abraham because some Jews are bad? If some do not believe does it hinder God's plan? Will unbelief cancel God's faithfulness? See 2 Timothy 2:13.

#### The Jews cling to their heritage as Abraham's children as their warranty (v. 3)

Their objection was even though some did not believe; nothing can nullify our special promises we have been given by God through Abraham. They were in effect saying no matter what else we are, we are Abraham's seed and that will get us into heaven.

#### The answer: absolutely not! (v. 4a)

> 2 Timothy 2:13 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he **cannot deny himself**.

#### Illustrated from David's life (v. 4b)

The Psalm of David is quoted which showed God to be righteous even when David was condemned for his sin. According to Psalm 51:4, God is just when He speaks and clear when He judges. This is used here to show that God is right to condemn the Jews because they rejected the Messiah who came from the seed of Abraham according to the promises. These promises they claimed would justify them in fact brought condemnation to the Jew because of their rejection of Jesus Christ.

### If our sin commends God's righteousness, how can He judge us? (v. 5—7)

#### Let us first understand the meaning of the question

We must rely on the context to help us understand the meaning of this question. This is posed as two questions in the text and has been simplified for the purpose of study. The question is literally asking: if our unrighteousness magnifies or brings attention to God's righteousness and mercy; is God unrighteous if He judges us?

#### God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

The answer is: Certainly not. For if this principle is used then how could God pass judgment on the world? The world here is referring to the Gentiles. It is proper for a righteous God to judge the unrighteous sinner—whether Jew or Gentile.

The truth is, God can judge the world because he is righteous.

### Let us do evil that good may come? (v. 8)

Some abuse the truth of God's mercy and boast that their sinful lives and God's unconditional acceptance, is illustrative of God's great mercy. Paul was not preaching this false doctrine, but was being accused of doing so.

Paul's description of those who did preach this was: whose damnation is just. Since the accusation was not true Paul did not go into a detailed answer; he only affirms that God's judgment on them is just.

## The unbending authority of the law (v. 9—20)

The whole world is under the sentence of condemnation.

### The charge is levied against the sinner (v. 9)

Who is a sinner? We have proven both Jew and Gentile to be under sin as all are guilty of breaking the law.

#### Witnesses are brought before the accused

1. The witness of creation (1:20)
2. The witness of conscience (2:15)
3. The witness of commandment (3:19)

### The indictment is read from the Scriptures (v. 10—18)

According to the rules of the court the indictment had to be written. The great Judge leaves no excuse for humanity and has Paul use the written Word to indict the accused.

The Jew boasted that he possessed the Scripture; now God is using that same Word to expose their sin. God is making them accountable to His Word.

### The defense of the accused (v. 19)

What is the defense of the accused? The accused has nothing to say; every mouth is stopped. The Day of Judgment will be a day of silence.

### The verdict (v. 20)

Guilty as charged!

#### No flesh is justified by deeds of law

This law refers to more than Moses Law; there is also reference to moral law and the law of conscience. The Gentile did not posses Moses's Law, but every man has the moral law of God written on his heart and testified to by his conscience.

#### The death penalty has been levied against the condemned (Rom. 6:23)

## The true purpose of the law (v. 21—30)

### The righteousness of God is manifested to men (v. 21—23)

To manifest is to show forth or to declare.

#### Declared righteous

The meaning of "justify" is to declare righteous. To be justified is to be placed in a right relationship with God. Paul is telling men how they can be justified or declared righteous: through Jesus Christ.

> Most important, justification does not mean that God makes us righteous, but that He declares us righteous. Justification is a legal matter. God puts the righteousness of Christ on our record in the place of our own sinfulness.<sup>[1]</sup>

### God's method of justification (v. 24)

#### Given by the Grace of God

Sinful man does not deserve to be justified. Man deserves to die because of sin. God freely justifies those who receive the provision of Christ by faith. Salvation is a gift of God to those who receive the provision of Christ by faith.

This is not earned righteousness or even righteous works. Justification is the righteousness of God put to the account of a man; that is God counting him righteous solely due to the righteousness of Christ. This passage is showing man the source of righteousness which only comes from God.

#### Through the redemption in Christ Jesus

Redemption means to purchase, to set free by the payment of a ransom. Jesus paid the price for our Salvation in His blood. Man is declared righteous solely on the merit of Jesus Christ.

### The demands of the law have been satisfied (v. 25)

#### God still requires justice

Justification is not merely God showing pity on the sinner and letting him go free without the penalty being paid. The word propitiation is used in reference to Christ satisfying the demands of the law. Propitiation is a reason for not executing judgment which is deserved. It corresponds to the Hebrew word rendered mercy seat which was the place the blood of atonement was sprinkled to satisfy the judgment of God. This sprinkled blood covered the tables of the law contained in the ark. This is a figure of Him who was to come and shed Divine blood to satisfy the law. The blood of Jesus is the reason that judgment is not executed on the repentant sinner.

#### For the remission of sins that are past

In the Old Testament period, the blood of animals could never take away sin (Heb. 10:4). The blood of animals, a shadow of the blood of Christ, was only temporary until the time when Jesus would come and offer Himself as the supreme sacrifice for sin. The literal translation of this phrase is: "God had passed over the sins that were past." This He did knowing that Jesus would come and pay the price in full upon the cross. The blood of animals was like a credit until the price could be paid. No man was ever saved by the blood of an animal; all men have only been saved by the blood of Jesus both Old Testament and New Testament.

### A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law (v. 28)

Faith is the requirement to receive from God. Works of the law cannot secure justification.

## The establishing of the law (v. 31)

Justification by faith establishes the law. The law of faith does not make the law useless or void, but establishes it. Faith does not remove or destroy the law, but excels the law.

The law brings the knowledge of sin to a man, and that man who has recognized his condition may be justified by faith. Without the law that man would have no knowledge of sin, and therefore would see no need for justification, redemption, or atonement. The law which was once broken is established through faith in the finished work of Christ. For through His righteousness it is satisfied.
