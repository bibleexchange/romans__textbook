## The Establishing of the Law (vs. 31)

Justification by faith establishes the law. The law of faith does not make the law useless or void, but establishes it. Faith does not remove or destroy the law, but excels the law.

The law brings the knowledge of sin to a man, and that man who has recognized his condition may be justified by faith. Without the law that man would have no knowledge of sin, and therefore would see no need for justification, redemption, or atonement. The law which was once broken is established through faith in the finished work of Christ. For through His righteousness it is satisfied.
