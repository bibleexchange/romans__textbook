## God will fulfill His promise (4:18—25)

### The promise to Abraham (v. 18—22)

Abraham was given the promise of God. God promised Abraham he would have a son. Also, the Messiah would be a son of Abraham. Jesus fulfilled prophecy and was born according to his natural lineage as a descendant of Abraham.

### The promise of justification (v. 23—24)

### The condition of justification (v. 24)

A person receives justification from God by faith.

### The courage of faith and the divine action of justification

Abraham believed the promise of God. Against hope believed in hope. Abraham believed in the promise of God regardless of the circumstances. Sarah was about 90 and Abraham was more than 100 years old. There was no natural way possible for them to have a child. Abraham staggered not at the promise of God (v. 20).

Justification is a divine activity. Man cannot justify himself any more than Abraham could produce a son. Justification is a work of God bestowed by grace in response to faith.
