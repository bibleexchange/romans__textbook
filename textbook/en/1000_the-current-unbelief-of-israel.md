# Chapter 10: The current unbelief of Israel

## They are not saved (10:1)

The Gospel is for the Jew (Rom. 1:16; 2:9—10). The majority of the Jews rejected the Gospel (Acts 2:22). The first persecution of Christians was largely from the Jews (Acts 9:1—2).

## The Jews' zeal (10:2)

The Pharisees: Minute Prescriptions added to the law (Acts 23:6; 26:5; Php. 3:5—6). Paul does not ignore their efforts. He witnesses to their "zeal of God."

## The Jews' ignorance (10:3—11)

They had a zeal of God, but were missing important truth: the righteousness of God which is by faith. The object of this faith is Jesus Christ the only begotton Son of God Who is the end of the law through faith. This faith comes by the Word of God and does not require ascending to heaven or hell first, but is already nigh.

## The Jews' path to God (10:12—15)

## The Jew's rejection of the Gospel (10:16—21)

**Read Isaiah 65:1—10**. God sends a preacher -> a preacher preaches -> an audience hears -> the hearer believes -> the believer calls on the name of the Lord -> the Lord saves him. Where is the disconnect? "They have not obeyed or heeded the Gospel."

- Did God send a preacher? Yes (v. 19, 20, Moses, Isaiah, etc.)
- Did the preacher preach? Yes (v. 16)
- Did the audience Hear? Yes (v. 18, Moses foretold, Isaiah foretold)

The hearers refused to believe. We have a responsibility in God's plan of redemption. God is using the Gentiles to provoke the Jew to jealousy (10:19).
