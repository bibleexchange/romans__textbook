# Chapter 9:

<!--Should add an introduction here that shows chapters 9-11 as a section that works together-->

## Paul's continuing love for the Jewish people (9:1—5)

Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles and he did not believe the law could save anyone, but he was still a Jew and greatly loved the Jewish people. Romans chapter nine talks about Paul's sorrow for the Jews. We find out that not all of Abraham's seed were the children of promise (9:7—8).

### The sincerity of his feeling (v. 1)

Paul's sorrow for the lost was sincere and divinely inspired.

### The intensity of his feeling (v. 2—3a)

**Paul carried the burden!** His sorrow was intense.

Paul has experienced great heaviness in sorrowing over Israel's condition as a whole. Paul comes to the place that he would even be willing to be accursed from Christ that his brethren might be found in Christ. This is a selfless declaration, but the proposition is not even possible. The sinner's light in their darkness is the justified, sanctified, holy life of believers that walk consistently in Christ and their own salvation is in Christ alone. Paul's proclamation is reminiscent of Moses in Exodus 32:32—33.

Paul makes it clear that his intense and sincere desire is all Israel be saved (Romans 9:1—5; 11:26; 10:1). God desires that all sinners be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9; Ezekiel 18:23; Matthew 23:37). Paul is righteous in his desire and not contrary to mind and will of God.

### The Basis of his feeling (v. 3b-5)

The Jews are still a special people because God has given them many blessings. Paul talks about seven parts of the Jews' spiritual heritage. To the Jew Pertains:

1. **Adoption** - God had chosen Israel over Ishmael
2. **Glory** - Shekinah presence of God
3. **Covenants** - Promises of God made to Israel
4. **Law** - Law given at Sinai
5. **Service** - Authorized worship as ordained by God
6. **Promises** - Promise of God are (yea and amen) to them that believe. The Jew had the promises of God, they even trusted in the law.
7. **Messiah of Israel**

Christ is a rock of stumbling to the Jew (Gal. 5:6; John 14:15; 1 Peter 2:7—8).

## The inclusion of Gentiles in the promise (9:6—29)

<!--Although Israel is composed of the descendants of a particular family line and is in that sense biological, its origin is not in the first instance biological because its creation and sustenance come from God.

### The true Israel is according to the promise (v. 6—10)

The majority of Israel has missed the point. Christ is the fulfillment of the law, but Israel stumbles over him as if a stone and hold to their laws and religion. They think they are the children of God because they are the children of Abraham and Isaac and that they are the ones to whom the law was revealed.

The fact that the Gentiles were included in the promises raises the questions "Did the Word of God fail?" and "Did God fail to carry out His promises?"

The real Israel is the elect, not a natural seed. We see the plan of God as it unfolds. Not everyone that is born a part of the nationality of Israel are a part of Spiritual Israel. The children of the Israel are only children of the flesh, but the children of the promise are the children of God (John 3:6 "born of the Spirit"). The New Testament church is referred to as "the Israel of God" (Galatians 6:16) because of their faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ—not because of their family lineage (10:1—4).

### Election or predestination is not of works of Him that calleth (v. 11—13)

Election is mentioned in verse eleven. Election or predestination is not an unrighteous act for God may justify whom He may and condemn whom he desires. All the good works of men cannot make them children of the promise, but that condition is dependent upon God showing mercy.

It is important to understand from Scripture how predestination or election works. Predestination and election is based upon God's foreknowledge. He knows the end from the beginning He knows who will receive and who will reject before they are even born (8:29). Some are given 100 years and others only a few. It is man's responsibility to respond in the time of mercy for turning to God cannot happen just on a man's whim, but he must be drawn by the Father (John 6:44).

### God is righteous in mercy and hardening (v. 14—18)

How is God's sovereignty expressed? God is a sovereign God so therefore he is also a just God.

### Clay in the potter's hand (v. 19—24)

#### God is Just (v. 19)

#### God is sovereign (and man is responsible) (v. 20)

#### God is purposeful (v. 21)

#### God is right

- Hypothetical "A" (v. 22)
- Hypothetical "B" (v. 23—24)

### The calling of God's people (v. 25—29)

In verse 25 Paul, takes from the prophet Hosea (2:23) a passage that is specifically spoken to Israel, but has not found a fulfillment in Israel but rather is seen fulfilled in the Gentiles receiving the Gospel. The sentences in the latter part of this verse are very abrupt, but exceedingly expressive; leaving out those words supplied by the translators: I will say to Not my people, thou my people; and they shall say, my God (1 Pet. 2:9—10).

In verse 26, we see the Gentile people. God's infinite grace takes up those who were once called "dogs" (Matt. 15:26) and gives them a heavenly calling "Called to be children of the living God."

In verse 27 the apostle quotes another prophet, Isaiah, concerning a remnant (Isa. 10:22).

The ways of God are not our ways. He waits long - He forbears - He is silent: then suddenly puts into execution an eternally formed purpose.

Verse 29 is a quote from Isaiah 1:9 shows that if God had not intervened by his grace, they would have all become as Sodom and Gomorrah (2 Thess. 2:7).

## Stumbling and overcoming: The conclusion of chapter 9 (9:30—33)

### Righteousness through faith (9:30)

The Gentiles, not following after righteousness (righteousness by the law), attain to it by faith. Faith is contrasted in the text in this way: seeking righteousness by the keeping of the law versus seeking righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ.

### No righteousness through the law (9:31)

Israel followed after the law of righteousness, but could not attain it (they could not keep the law). Israel, following after the law stumbled at the way.

### Must seek righteousness by faith (9:32)

Israel did not seek it by faith.

### A stumblingblock is Laid (9:33)

They stumbled over the rock of offense. They stumbled over Jesus. He offended the leaders of Israel by exposing sin.

What is the message of the Gospel that is open to all? "And whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed." God's mercy is illustrated by His dealings with both Jew and Gentile. Humility and awe are the proper attitudes for both Jew and Gentile who experience the mercy and kindness of God. Whether a man is a Jew or a Gentile, his salvation depends upon more or less than what he thinks and does with Jesus. Submission to God's way of righteousness by personal acknowledgement of Jesus as the risen Lord, brings a man into "Right standing with God."
