## Patiently wait for the adoption (v. 18—25)

Because of sin's presence in the world, we do not see the fulness of the glory of God. The believer has great things to look forward to in God. God has done great things in and for the believer and there is yet a redemption that we patiently wait for in hope or faith! What does the believer have to look forward to?

### Suffering unto glorification (v. 18)

Trials prove the true character of the Christian. Although the suffering is not glorious, Paul brings our attention to glory that will follow. The Christian has hope in suffering, for if we suffer, we shall also reign. Christ is our example of suffering (1 Pet. 2:21; Heb. 2:10; 5:8—9; 1 Pet. 4:1; James 5:10).

### The creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God (v. 19—22)

God has a vast plan and hope lies ahead for creation. In bondage because sin is in the world, but there will be a deliverance!
