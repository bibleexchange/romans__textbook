# Paul's continuing love for the Jewish people (9:1—5)

Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles and he did not believe the law could save anyone, but he was still a Jew and greatly loved the Jewish people. Romans chapter nine talks about Paul's sorrow for the Jews. We find out that not all of Abraham's seed were the children of promise (9:7—8).

## The Sincerity of his feeling (v. 1)

Paul's sorrow for the lost was sincere and divinely inspired.

## The Intensity of his feeling (v. 2—3a)

**Paul carried the burden!** His sorrow was intense.

Paul has experienced great heaviness in sorrowing over Israel's condition as a whole. Paul comes to the place that he would even be willing to be accursed from Christ that his brethren might be found in Christ. This is a selfless declaration, but the proposition is not even possible. The sinner's light in their darkness is the justified, sanctified, holy life of Believers that walk consistently in Christ and their own salvation is in Christ alone. Paul's proclamation is reminiscent of Moses in Exodus 32:32—33.

Paul makes it clear that his intense and sincere desire is all Israel be saved (Romans 9:1—5; 11:26; 10:1). God desires that all sinners be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9; Ezekiel 18:23; Matthew 23:37). Paul is righteous in his desire and not contrary to mind and will of God.

## The Basis of his feeling (v. 3b-5)

The Jews are still a special people because God has given them many blessings. Paul talks about seven parts of the Jews' spiritual heritage. To the Jew Pertains:

1. **ADOPTION** - God had chosen Israel over Ishmael
2. **GLORY** - Shekinah presence of God
3. **COVENANTS** - Promises of God made to Israel
4. **LAW** - Law given at Sinai
5. **SERVICE** - Authorized worship as ordained by God
6. **PROMISES** - Promise of God are (yea and amen) to them that believe. The Jew had the promises of God, they even trusted in the law.
7. **MESSIAH OF ISRAEL**

Christ is a rock of stumbling to the Jew (Gal. 5:6; John 14:15; 1 Peter 2:7—8).
